## Maps

Maps are collections that store key-value pairs. In this section, you'll find examples and explanations for different types of maps, such as:

- `HashMap`
- `TreeMap`
- `LinkedHashMap`

## Multi-Threading

Multi-threading allows concurrent execution of multiple threads. This section covers:

- Creating and running threads
- Synchronization
- Thread communication

## Sets and HashSets

Sets are collections that do not allow duplicate elements. This section includes:

- `HashSet`
- `LinkedHashSet`
- `TreeSet`

## Lambda Expressions

Lambda expressions provide a concise way to represent anonymous functions. This section includes:

- Syntax and usage
- Functional interfaces
- Examples of lambda expressions in action

## Buffered Reader and Buffered Writer

These classes are used for efficient reading and writing of text data. This section includes:

- How to use `BufferedReader` for reading text from a file
- How to use `BufferedWriter` for writing text to a file

## FlatMaps

`FlatMap` is used to transform a stream of elements into another stream of elements. This section includes:

- Basic usage of `FlatMap`
- Examples with Java Streams

## Comparable Interface

The `Comparable` interface is used to define a natural ordering of objects. This section includes:

- Implementing the `Comparable` interface
- Examples of custom sorting

## Comparator Interface

The `Comparator` interface is used to define custom sorting logic. This section includes:

- Implementing the `Comparator` interface
- Examples of custom comparators
